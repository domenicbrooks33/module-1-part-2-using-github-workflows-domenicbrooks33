## Overview
The `addition_function.py` script in this repository allows the user to calculate the sum of any two values, which are inputted by the user. It is a very simple program, requiring no other outside modules or packages except for Python itself.

## How to Run
First clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`. Once you have the script on your local machine, in your terminal run:
```bash
python addition_function.py
```
You will be prompted to enter 2 values (can be a float or integer) which you want to sum together. Once you enter those, the output sum of the values will appear in the terminal.
